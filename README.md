## Testing Asahi Linux userspace audio configuration on 16,1 T2 Mac.

Thanks to chadmed and Asahi Linux.

The project has been adjusted to test Asahi Linux audio workflow on a MacBook Pro 16,1 2019 with T2 audio driver.

The original FIRs were created for a MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) so not specfic for a 16,1.
